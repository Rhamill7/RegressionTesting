The program will run the genetc algorithm. In the main class, to run the Hill Climber algorithm remove the /* and */ above and below the ///////////////////// lines and comment out the while loop and the System.out.println("Gen Number: "....) statement.
To run the different data files, the 'faultNumber' and 'totalTests' variables in the main class will need to be changed depending on the file. The fileScanner() method will also need to be changed in the Population class, to change the name of the file.
